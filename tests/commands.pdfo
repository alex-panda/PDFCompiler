This is a file all about commands.

What are commands?

They allow you to mark up your text---to "command" it to be a certain way or
have something happen to it.

For example:

\\b{} will \b{bold any text you put inbetween its two curly brackets "{}".}
\\i{} will \i{italicise any text you put inbetween its two curly brackets.}
\\u{} will \u{underline any text you put inbetween its two curly brackets.}

This is the pattern of all commands. You do \\, then the name of the cammand
you want to do, and then put the text you want to do it to in between the
command's curly-brackets "{}".

Some commands need more than one thing between curly brackets in order to work.

For example:

\\font{Times New Roman}{}

Changes the text in the second set of curly brackets to be in Times New Roman font.
This can  be done like so:

\font{Times New Roman}{This text is in Times New Roman.}

If you are looking at the plaintext version of this file, then you will notice
that I've been putting two backslashes "\\" every time I need to type one.
That is because one backslash symbolizes that there must be a command after it,
but by putting two I am saying "no, there is no command here, I just want a single
backslash to be displayed here in the PDF version of this file."
